I saw this on [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/elon-musk-puts-spacex-photos-into-the-public-domain) the other day, but just got around to writing about it.

Elon Musk and SpaceX have decided to release all their photos in the public domain, just like NASA does. Of course the reason NASA's photos are public domain is because they're created by employees of the federal government and are thus ineligible for copyright. SpaceX is under no such obligation, which makes their move quite refreshing.

The photos are currently [hosted on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacexphotos), and while they appear there under a Creative Commons license, that's only due to a limitation of Flickr's site.

On the one hand, this story is a perfect excuse to post some beautiful launch photography here. On the other, it's a great example of forward-thinking corporate leadership finding more value in sharing than in miserly copyright obsession.
