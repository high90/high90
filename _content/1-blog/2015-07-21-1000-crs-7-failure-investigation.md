[NASA Space Flight](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com) is one of my favorite places to get detailed space news. Their RSS feed and news articles are free, although they offer even more depth via their [L2](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/) subscription service. I like that they have a more technical approach than other space news sites.

[Their most recent post](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/07/spacex-falcon-9-failure-investigation-focuses-update/) offers several new details on the SpaceX CRS-7 failure investigation:

> SpaceX CEO and Chief Designer Elon Musk has updated the status of the investigation into the failure of the Falcon 9 rocket during its ill-fated CRS-7 Dragon mission. The preliminary findings point to a support strut in the Second Stage LOX tank breaking, releasing a helium pressurization bottle (Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel) that began the series of events that resulted in the loss of the vehicle.

As far as the mishap investigation is concerned, I'm hopeful SpaceX can nail down the cause of this soon so the [Dragon 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_V2) test plan stays on track. SpaceX and its commercial peers are our best hope for fixing what's wrong with space exploration in this country, and I like Musk's [open](http://high90.pub/blog/spacex-puts-their-photos-in-public-domain), optimistic, and occasionally [self-effacing](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/555981841476227072) approach to PR.
