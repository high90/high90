[NASA Space Flight](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/07/spacex-falcon-9-failure-investigation-focuses-update/) has a highly detailed post about the current state of the SpaceX CRS-7 failure investigation:

> SpaceX CEO and Chief Designer Elon Musk has updated the status of the investigation into the failure of the Falcon 9 rocket during its ill-fated CRS-7 Dragon mission. The preliminary findings point to a support strut in the Second Stage LOX tank breaking, releasing a helium pressurization bottle (Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel) that began the series of events that resulted in the loss of the vehicle.

NASA Space Flight is one of my favorite places to get detailed space news. Their RSS feed and news articles are free (although they offer even more depth via their [L2](http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/l2/) subscription service) and usually have much more technical information on hand than other sites.

As far as the CRS-7 mishap investigation is concerned, I'm hopeful that they can nail down the cause of this soon, so they can stay on track for the [Dragon 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_V2) test plan. SpaceX and its commercial peers are our best hope for fixing what's wrong with space exploration in this country, and I like Musk's [open](http://high90.pub/blog/spacex-puts-their-photos-in-public-domain), optimistic, and occasionally [self-effacing](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/555981841476227072) approach to PR.
