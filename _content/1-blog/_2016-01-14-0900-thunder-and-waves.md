Is there anything better than the sound of thunder and rain? It touches our souls somewhere deep, way back in that part of our brain we share with our older cousins. 

Through some bit of genetic magic, our reptilian minds hear the sound of rain, the wind in the trees, waves on a beach, or a stream falling on rocks, and they respond by crawling into a dry mental crevice somewhere so they can wait out the storm in peace. Something about those sounds shorcuts the thinking mind, putting us back in a place where we can relax and focus. The cold mechanical whirrs, roars and crashes of modern life become muted and distant. The clanging soundtrack that repeats endlessly in our consciousness finally fades away. 

We are home.

I purchased my first thunderstorm CD in college. It cost something like $4.99, which was cheap even in 1996. The cover had a picture of a prairie shack with a storm behind it. The disk played about 60 minutes of wind, thunder, and rain. The storm faded in, the storm faded out.

That CD got me through several long research papers. In a DC rowhouse with thin walls, drowning out seven housemates and the ambulances regularly screaming down the block was critical. Those long papers sure weren't going to write themselves, but with a more pleasant audio backdrop it sometimes seemed that way.

One challenge was that those CDs had an end. You could put them on repeat, but you always knew that they'd fade out or skip a beat while they reset. While this wasn't a huge deal during the daytime, it got a bit jarring when used at night. When MP3 revolution hit, the CDs became files on a computer. The wonders of this new technology made that jarring reset faster, but not substantially more elegant. 

I gave up on background noise for sleeping, and after graduating from pilot training there was little need for study aids. Nature sounds became less important, and they stayed that way right up until I got married.

I snore. This proved to be inconvenient for my wife. She's on call a few nights a week, which often means the phone rings at all hours. This was inconvenient for me. Soon our son was born. He joined us in our room for the first few weeks of his life. None of us could sleep, since someone was always making a racket.

[Naturespace][5] came to our rescue. Their first iOS app was called *Thundergod*, and it played five different tracks with varying storm intensities. The key advantage it had was that the tracks were all perfectly looped. No gaps, no jarring resets.

With the help of an old first-gen iPhone and a 30-pin clock-radio dock from iHome I fired up the app and picked the track named *Aegir* -- a mixture of crashing ocean waves and a robust, windy, thunderstorm.

Our son slept like a baby, which (when you think about it) is the least baby-like thing he could possibly do. He moved to his own room several weeks later. The storms followed.

That was great, but my snoring wasn't. Fortunately I hadn't sold my old (in the age of the iPhone 4) iPhone 3GS. A second clock-radio dock joined us in our bedroom. Thunderstorms have now been raging in our house for five years straight. Both iPhones are still going strong. 

Naturespace broadened its offerings and made a [new app][6] with a much broader variety of sounds. The 3GS can handle it, but the first-gen iPhone stayed behind. It's still happily chugging away with Thundergod, and probably will continue at least into its second decade.

My son still uses his iHome dock, but a few years ago [Bob][7] talked me into buying a [Sonos][8] system, which metastasized to the bedroom in surprisingly little time. Two PLAY:1s in a stereo pair now grace our nighstands. 

The PLAY:1 doesn't have a line-in, so we attached the 3GS via line-in to a PLAY:5 downstairs. The Sonos app pipes it to the bedroom without an issue. It doesn't even need to be playing on the PLAY:5 to do so. Using [Macronos][9] on a Nexus 5, the bedroom speakers get auto-switched to thunderstorms every night at bedtime.

Twenty years later, I'm still not very good at focusing in a noisy environment. Whenever it's time to sit down and really concentrate, I fire up Naturespace, put on a pair of headphones, and get to work. Soothed once again, the noisy parts of my brain crawl into another crevice in the rock wall, sit back, and enjoy the show.9
