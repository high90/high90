> Angular wants you to build your application in a particular way, but it’s not very explicit about it. Call it “passive-aggressive architecture.”

I've been building a few pet projects with Angular over the last year. Like a lot of folks, I was captivated how Angular handled data-binding which made rapid-prototyping *almost magical*. It was only too easy to attribute any complications and frustrations to inexperience, expecially with so many developers championing the framework.

Only now have I started to realize there might be fundamental issues with it. The Angular team agrees, having announced [version 2](http://jaxenter.com/angular-2-0-112094.html), a ground-up rebuild that has not been without [controvery](angular 2 controversy).

I have a lot to say about Angular, and web applications frameworks in general, but for now [James Shore](https://twitter.com/jamesshore)'s review of Angular hits the nail on the head.
