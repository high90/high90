But what really concerns me is that there doesn’t seem to be an end.

## The Problem

Erik’s post touched a nerve. It’s one of those posts where I immediately want to tell him he’s wrong. Not in a “but I’m right” sort of way, but rather “we’re *all* doing it wrong.”

His frustration is all too familiar. It's my frustration too. But hearing my own arguments back at me, I realized his particular viewpoint on what the middle computer should look like, while not wrong, is overlooking a scary point. Why do we need a middle at all?

<aside class="left sidebar small" markdown="1">Erik says he doesn’t need an iPad, for he can do everything it does on his phone. I find it amusing, because I would say almost the exact same thing — I don’t need my *phone*, as I can do everything on my *tablet*. The iPad is better at most of them and I already have it. Where the tablet falls short, there are more capable options.</aside>

Apple, along with all the other tech manufacturers are only too happy to help me find these gaps, often — and I’m sure coincidentally — just before they tell me they have something that can fill that gap. How wonderfully convenient.

The problem is it’s a continuous scale. There are an infinite number of gaps between an infinite number of items. Give me a 7-inch and an 8-inch tablet, and I’m sure I can construct a case where I’d absolutely need a 7.5-inch one. There’s always a corner-case, and if there’s not a device to fill it now, there will be eventually. That’s a dark and dangerous road, unless you’re the one selling these things.

I assure you, I’m not trying to pick on Erik. He’s advocating a phone, a laptop, and a desktop. That’s perfectly reasonable for his job, sparse even.

My point is, it’s completely arbitrary - and therefore impossible to meaningfully achieve.

Personally, I find myself locked in a cycle where I perpetually shift between believing I need two computers — a desktop and a laptop — and believing I instead need three: a desktop, a powerful, full-featured laptop, and another less-capable, but smaller and even more portable laptop. As I continually buy and sell this maybe machine, I either feel as if I have a gap in my setup, or and excess of computers.

I’m never satisfied.

## The Cause

My toolkit isn’t based on my workflow. At best, it’s based on the requirements and purchases of others I trust, respect, and perhaps envy. At worst — and far more likely — it’s based on billions of dollars - and millions of hours - of marketing research and evaluation with the singular goal of convincing me that I *need* something.

About a year ago, I read an interview with a designer where he’s discussing his toolset. The interviewer was trying to poke him a little, asking why he’s picked tech object *A* instead of *B*. He wasn't having any of it, and simply responded with something to the effect of:

> People who know what they are doing don’t struggle with choosing their tools.

That was painful to hear. I struggle with my tools *every day*. I'd like to think I know what I’m doing. I went into defensive-mode, blew off the rest of the article — a regret, I wish I could find it again — and moved on.

Except I couldn’t get that idea out of my head. And over the last year I have learned that he was absolutely right.

If you were ask me to sit down and build you a webapp — without hesitation — I’d be sitting at my desk in my office, on my Mac Pro, using SublimeText, typing on a HHKB. If I have to work outside the home, Macbook Pro. Again, no question.

So, why do I torture myself with fiddling with my toolset? It’s more than just buying shiny new toys — while that certainly plays a part — there’s something else, a deeper need.

Fortunately, I think I understand.

Computers are tricky tools. They’re flexible, so mutable, that just because they supposed to be able to do just about anything, it’s easy to convince ourselves they *need* to do everything. The truth is, most computing devices are good for only a small subset of tasks, and are pretty terrible at everything else.

Makers see untapped potential everywhere. Every pile of junk is a new thing, every spare CPU cycle is another process, and wheel there is plenty of joy to be found in that, like all obsessions, there is danger of taking it too far.

My television has wifi, usb ports, a pretty great display, and a fairly impressive CPU. It even has an app store. Do I feel a need to check my email on that? Of course not, it’s an appliance, and I’m satisfied to let it do it’s job.

*No, that's a bad example, if I'm going to do this, let's go full reductio ad absurdum.*

My pipe wrench is a fairly substantial chunk of metal, there’s no reason it shouldn’t be able to handle all my nail-pounding tasks. I already have a pipe wrench, and it’s much more capable at wrenching tasks than a hammer.

I’ve always hated being described as someone who “likes computers”. I like what I *do* with computers: programming, writing, design, drawing, making music, reading, listening to much, watching movies. While I am incredibly particular about my computers, as I am with all of my tools, they are the means to an end. No one describes van Gogh as a guy who “likes paintbrushes”.
</aside>

So why do I feel this drive to make *all* my computing appliances do *everything*? It’s one thing to know that I can ssh into a server for a quick vim update when it’s all I have, just like you can be damned sure that I have used that pipe wrench to pound things. But to expect it to work as well as, or to put myself in a situation where that was my expected primary tool? It’s ridiculous, and frankly, disrespectful to my work.

## The Solution

So, now that I can wrap my brain around why this is so difficult. This impossible ideal of expecting computing devices to be perfect [universal machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine) burdens them with an unreasonable expectations. They can only disappoint.

Yup, I'm blaming Alan Turing for my tech addiction. Reverse Godwin?

It's not a simple task to break out of this cycle.

1. Buy the best tool for the job.

	I'd like to append "but no more." to the old adage. That's because I need to:

2. Embrace Specialization.

	This is hard for me. I have always been a generalist. However, I need to embrace a little focus in my life, and do less things, better. My tools should reflect that mentality.

3. Buy solutions, not capabilities.

	Capabilities are easy to spot. They're all the reverse-justifications you make to yourself. *If I got this, I could...*

4. Stop worrying about what others are doing. They almost certainly don’t have the same requirements as you.

	Listen to yourself, rather than a keynote, or a review.

5. Fail early and fail often. I know it’s a running joke that I tend to buy everything, and then almost immediately turn around and return or sell it, but I think that’s been helpful to making sure I have the right tools. Only I know what’s right for me, and often it’s the seemingly-insignificant features that make all the difference, those intangibles that you won’t find in a review.

	If something isn’t working, get rid of it as soon as possible. And if you find yourself updating and replacing something over and over again, don’t be so quick to swap it out of your workflow with the latest and greatest.

6. Perhaps, just maybe, actually try enjoying what you have.
