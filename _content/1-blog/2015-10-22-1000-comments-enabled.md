We've decided to add comments to our site via [Disqus](http://disqus.com).

I know... I can hear you now:

*Wait... what?!*

So why did we do it? It's pretty simple, really.

First, we like you. We think you're a smart person with an adult level of self-control. We want to hear what you think about the stuff we write and talk about on our site and our podcast.

<p class="has-pullquote" data-pullquote="We think you're a smart person" markdown=1>Second, we feel confident enough in the control Disqus gives us that moderation is an achievable goal. [Gabe Weatherhead](http://twitter.com/macdrifter) has managed to have a solid and productive comments section for years at [Macdrifter](http://macdrifter.com). He continues to be an inspiration to all of us.</p>

Third, we wanted a way to expand on each post in context, and with less friction than writing a whole new post.

So why Disqus?

We use [Statamic](http://statamic.com) as our CMS. It's fantastic and offers a nice balance of static and dynamic features. The one thing it doesn't currently offer is native comments. It does offer great support for Disqus via a first-party plugin, so we've gone there. It seemed like a better choice than changing the whole CMS.

We've got some great stuff ahead of us. We're excited to share it with you and hear what you think about it.

Thanks for listening, and talk to you soon.
