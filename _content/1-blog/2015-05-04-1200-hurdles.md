I'm in the second week of my transition to a more iOS-friendly mobile workflow, and it's been enlightening so far. But not exactly in the way I expected.

There are, of course, things that iOS just can't do - editing Photoshop and Illustrator files, resize a browser window to test a responsive layout, and serve up an offline stand-alone web development environment are the some of the first things that come to mind. 

That being said, there's so much this platform *can* do that I wonder how many of my previous complaints were really just me of getting in my own way.

I've carried a laptop with me for years, but I could usually come up with a reason why I wasn't quite ready to work on that much more capable platform. Maybe I didn't have the right editor, maybe I forgot my mouse and had to use the trackpad, maybe there was something terribly annoying about how my `.vimrc` file just wouldn't display the editor's color scheme correctly.

None of those "problems" were real obstacles. They were all just handy excuses.

The more time that passes, the more I realize that we're the ones putting all these hurdles in our way. We're the ones telling ourselves that we just need a slightly different notebook, or just the right font, or the perfect keyboard. *Then* we'll be ready to get to business.

Freddy Rumsen is one of my favorite characters on Mad Men and he gets one of the best lines in an already great show. That line has been coming back to me more and more lately. 

*"Do the work, Don."*
