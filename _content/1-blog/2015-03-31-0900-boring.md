[Dan McKinley](https://twitter.com/mcfunley)'s post on avoiding over-innovation when selecting technologies meshes really well with our [recent discussions](http://high90.pub/high90cast/003-methadone-for-bobs-phone-addiction).

> Mindful choice of technology gives engineering minds real freedom: the freedom to contemplate bigger questions. Technology for its own sake is snake oil.

I completely agree. As I've been learning recently, it's less about the *right* tool, but rather the tool that *works*. And I can't stress this enough, what works for you may not be the new, shiny, technology-of-the-month.

Live with the boring choice now, and you will have the time end energy to devote to the real interesting problems.
