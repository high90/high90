I recently ran across the hilariously satirical [Scarfolk Council](http://scarfolk.blogspot.com/) blog. 

From the site's header:

> Scarfolk is a town in North West England that did not progress beyond 1979. Instead, the entire decade of the 1970s loops ad infinitum. Here in Scarfolk, pagan rituals blend seamlessly with science; hauntology is a compulsory subject at school, and everyone must be in bed by 8pm because they are perpetually running a slight fever. "Visit Scarfolk today. Our number one priority is keeping rabies at bay." For more information please reread.

The whole site is full of beautifully-wrong-yet-perfect recreations of 1970s-era design, like the awesome book covers above. 

Be careful while visiting &ndash; if you're like me you might not stop until you've read through the whole site.
