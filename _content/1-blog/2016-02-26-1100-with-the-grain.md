[Potatowire](http://twitter.com/potatowire) has written several insightful pieces at his new site [With the Grain](http://with.thegra.in "With the Grain"). 

From the [introductory post](http://with.thegra.in/with-the-grain):

> For decades, I tried to make wholesale, sweeping changes to who I am, with minimal success. In the last few years, and almost in spite of myself, I came to realize that I could make real meaningful improvements to myself, if I took the time to better consider my *current state* before enacting a plan to bring about a *final* state.

I'm really looking forward to seeing this series develop. But before you start reading it, maybe you should go [make your bed](http://with.thegra.in/make-your-bed).
