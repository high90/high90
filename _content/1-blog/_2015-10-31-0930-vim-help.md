Hello all, some of you may already ["know"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymity) me, but I am potatowire, formerly of [Technical Difficulties](http://technicaldifficulties.us/) show notes and [Dawn Patrol](http://technicaldifficulties.us/dawn-patrol). I am also the Chief Vim Officer (CVO) for high90, and today begins a series of Vim tutorials. They will continue until I am fired, you lose interest, or Vim is [bested by emacs](http://replygif.net/i/1223.gif).

For my inaugural post, I am going to discuss Vim's built-in help system. Vim's internal documentation is fantastic, and if I had it all to do over again, I would have bought [a ton of Apple stock in 1998 or 2002](http://www.ocregister.com/articles/apple-343797-buckingham-stock.html), and I would have properly learned how to navigate Vim's help. Astute reader's may remember much of this from the show notes of [my Vim episode of TD](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/077-learning-vim-with-potatowire), but I thought it was useful then, and I think it is useful now too.

I can say without reservation that Vim has the best documentation of any software application I have ever used, but, this being Vim, you'll have to dig in a little before this fact becomes evident. Heck, you can even run `:h[elp] help` (which opens `helphelp.txt`), but I'll seek to provide a more succinct guide here.

First of all, some conventions for Vim and for this article. Vim has two ways of refering to its commands, one complete, and one short. For instance, you can go the help by typing `:help` or `:h` in your Vim window. The `[ ]` sets off the "extra" part of the full command.

> If this only served to display the words themselves, you are in Insert mode an should instead type `<Escape>` first to go to Normal mode. You may also want to start with my [aforementioned show notes](http://technicaldifficulties.us/episodes/077-learning-vim-with-potatowire)].

If you are browsing help just to learn, you probably want to have it take up the whole window instead of having it split. If so, type <C-W>o. This is the other main convention. `<C>` indicates the Control key, and a `-` next to the `C` means you should type it in combination with another key, `W` in this case. <C-W> is the way that you talk to the window, and in this case you are typing saying "Window, only," because you want the active window split to be the only window split.

Regardless of how you get there, once you are in the help files, you can get away with just typing `/` to search and then navigate by going forward with `n` and backwards with `N`. That works fine, and I did it for years, but it is much better to utilize the *tags* in Vim help. With your cursor in any `|bookmark|`, typing `<C-]>` will search for where that *tag* is defined in the help files. Even better, if you see an interesting term in the documentation, `<C-]>` will search the help tags for whatever `WORD` the cursor is on.

> Vim distinguishes between `words` and `WORDS`. There is a pretty good description of what this means [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14390568), but stated simply, a `word` is a word in the usual sense, while a `WORD` is any combination of non-[whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)) characters surrounded by whitespace.

Now, as you move around from tag to tag, you may want to go back, and the way to do that is either with `<C-T>` (think "Control Tag"), which jumps you back one previous entry in the tag stack, or with `<C-O>` (think "Control Older"), which jumps you back one older entry in the "jump list" of old cursor positions (`<C-I>` (think Control In" as moving further in) takes you to newer cursor positions in the jump list). Jumping by cursor position is good if you have used `/` to search a little within the help file.

All of this assumes that you know what the help subject you want is, but Vim provides some tools if you don't know exactly what you want. The first step here is to ensure that "wildmenu" on with `:set wildmenu`. Wildmenu in Vim allows for `<Tab>` completion in [Command Mode](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_the_vi_Editor/Vim/Modes#command-line), and it is fantastic. In this case, if you type `:h patt<Tab>`, Vim will cycle through the available options with each `<Tab>`. Even better, because the list of potential matches is sometimes long, you can type `:h patt<C-D>` and see a list of the available possibilities.

Another option when you are shooting blind is to use `helpgrep` by typing `helpg[rep] {pattern}`. You can navigate through the matches with the `:cn[ext]` or `:cp[revious]` to jump around between the matches. Or use `:cw[indow]` to get the list of matches all at once. `{pattern}` corresponds to a pattern in the Regular Expressions sense, but I'll save that for another time.

Speaking of "another time," I think that is a pretty good place to stop for now. Let me know what you think in the [fancy new comments section](http://high90.com/blog/comments-enabled), and [I am probably still on Twitter](https://twitter.com/potatowire/status/648907953412698112).
