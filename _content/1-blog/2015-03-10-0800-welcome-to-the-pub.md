Bob and I were looking at the top-level-domain (TLD) landscape the other day, and `.wow` is it crazy. `.wtf`?

A vast range of unlikely (and fairly new) gTLDs have hit the streets in the last year, like `.ninja` and `.rocks`. 

<p class="has-pullquote" data-pullquote="It could make choosing domain-names easier. Maybe." markdown="1">While we're no strangers to domain-name excess here at high90 (we touched on that topic a bit with [Gabe](http://twitter.com/macdrifter) and [Potatowire](http://twitter.com/potatowire) on [Episode 008](http://technicaldifficulties.us/dawn-patrol/008-schrodingers-cat-box) of the late, great [Dawn Patrol](http://technicaldifficulties.us/dawn-patrol)) there are so many new TLDs out there that the possibility of having a "house TLD" is now theoretically possible.</p>

What do I mean by "house TLD"? Well, by choosing a fairly unique, unplundered, and less-squatted TLD namespace for all your company or personal projects, customers might hypothetically associate it with your products, making it easier to find you. It also hypothetically could make choosing those project domain-names easier. Maybe. 

With `.com`, `.net` and now even `.io` becoming harder and harder to mine for good names, ICANN's approval of a wide range of new TLDs over the last year was well timed.

Those are the main reasons we've redirected our website from `high90.com` to `high90.pub`.

That and `.pub` sounded cool... or something.

We briefly experimented with `.haus` for it's Teutonic awesomeness, but then we realized that there's also `.house` which could get really confusing.

On a more serious note, I can see some advantages to picking a quirky new TLD and sticking with it across all of your products. The classic TLDs of the `.com` era are no longer as critical as they once were in the user-familiarity department. Additionally, it's much more common for people to use search rather than type a URL in their increasingly-capable browser omni-boxes. 

Those are also all excellent counter-arguments to the house-TLD idea. If people don't care anymore, then why bother at all? 

One place domain names still *do* matter is email, where misrouting still seems fairly common. Why go with `me@company.strange` when people will probably send everything to `me@company.com` instead?

Wait, was that a pro, or a con? I forgot...

Anyway, the value of the house TLD concept probably comes down to a matter of personal and corporate taste. For us, `.pub` had a fun feel that brought to mind a place you'd gather, either for beer or just to be seen in public. It also had the benefit of still being three letters, so it avoids a lot of the strangeness around long strings like `.technology`. Finally, many of the new gTLDs like `.solutions` sound like the domain equivalent of [cheesy stock-photos](http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/vince-vaughn-and-costars-pose-idiotic-stock-photos-you-can-have-free-163239). 

So `.pub` it is!

...at least until we change our minds again.
