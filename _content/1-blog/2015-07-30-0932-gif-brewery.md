[Six Colors](http://sixcolors.com/) is one of my favorite sites. Today [Dan Moren](https://twitter.com/dmoren) found a neat app that [Potatowire](http://twitter.com/potatowire) would love:

> I’ve played with a bunch of different tools for making GIFs, and I’ve found them to be a mixed bag—especially the web-based ones, which all too often restrict certain features for “premium” users, or produce less than great quality results.

> But I’ve been pretty pleased with GIFBrewery for OS X. It handles the videos I’ve imported with aplomb, supports cropping, resizing, and very easy trimming, which is key when making a good GIF. And because producing a compact animated image is important, it also lets you reduce the number of frames, change the delay between them, and simplify the color palette.
