Walking the dog while listening to podcasts is about as close to singletasking as I get these days, so I particularly enjoyed a recent talk by [Gil Fronsdal](http://www.audiodharma.org/teacher/1/) of [Audio Dharma](http://www.audiodharma.org/) entitled [*Doing One Thing at a Time*](http://www.audiodharma.org/talks/audio_player/5887.html).

There's no more Buddhist-specific discussion than you'd expect on a random episode of [*Back to Work*](http://5by5.tv/b2w), so don't worry if the intricacies of the Dharma aren't your thing. Focus and distraction are universal human challenges &ndash; especially in the age of the Internet &ndash; and Gil's talk had some excellent points on that topic.

There's a nuanced discussion near the end about how one task can often have multiple facets. The example Gil uses is cooking, where a chef may be juggling the stove, oven, and cutting board but is still fully engaged in the act of making food. His description reminded me of the concentrated attention it takes to land on an aircraft carrier.

During the last 3/4 miles of an approach, a pilot's focus narrows to three things: angle of attack (also known as AOA or alpha &ndash; roughly proportional to airspeed), glideslope, and lineup. AOA is derived from internal indicators (indexers or the e-bracket on the HUD), glideslope comes from the lens, and lineup comes from the centerline markings painted on the carrier's landing area.

As a pilot, you sweep through all these items regularly as part of a scan, then move the stick, throttle, and (depending on the aircraft) rudder pedals to get them to change in helpful rather than unhelpful directions. The whole scan, correct, scan process is continuous and the loop itself takes about two seconds to complete for an experienced pilot. On most approaches that means a pilot cycles through the process about eight times.

Landing on a carrier (especially at night) is one of the most engaging experiences I've had. In the moment you're so concentrated that all your scanning and control movements are part of a coordinated process. It's as close as I've ever come to the "flow" state David Allen alludes to in his book Getting Things Done.

Distraction occasionally strikes all pilots, and the most insidious kind masquerades as attention. Occasionally your scan will "break down" and instead of constantly moving you'll fixate on one item (say, the ball) to the exclusion of the others. This kind of fixation can result in a bad approach at best and a mishap at worst. It's why we've got Landing Signal Officers watching, assisting, and critiquing each landing aboard ship.
