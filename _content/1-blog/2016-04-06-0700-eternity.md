Some days I think [Vic Chesnutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Chesnutt) was right about the afterlife:

<blockquote class="poetry">
When I stop breathing,<br/>
And my poor old heart finally gives out,<br/>
I will spend eternity<br/>
Debriefing<br/>
<br/>
When I deplete the funds,<br/>
And they're forced to pull the plug &ndash;<br/>
Chiseled on my tombstone:<br/>
Debriefing
</blockquote>
