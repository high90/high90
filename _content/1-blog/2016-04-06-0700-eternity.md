Occasionally I'll encounter a day that makes me think [Vic Chesnutt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Chesnutt) was right about the afterlife:

*When I stop breathing,* 
*And my poor old heart finally gives out,*
*I will spend eternity*
*Debriefing*

*When I deplete the funds,*
*And they're forced to pull the plug &ndash;*
*Chiseled on my tombstone:*
*Debriefing*
