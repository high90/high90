Sometimes I wonder about the filters we place between reality and our perceptions of it.

I can be moody at times, and when I finally pull myself out of the funk, I often realize that my attitude has been influenced by a gap in personal maintenance. 

Lack of sleep can hit me hard, and the effects of sleep debt tend to build over time. Not enough healthy food, an excess of unhealthy food, or too little water can all make a big difference in my daily mood. Regular exercise is tough at first, feels great when I get into a routine, and is the first commitment I let go of when things get busy.

Whenever these sorts of personal maintenance tasks get out of whack, it's like I've put on a pair of tinted glasses. Something with me is wrong, but instead of realizing it I feel like *something in the world* is wrong. In my mind, there's something *external* that I have to fix.

After a short while, I usually get a glimmer of insight that *my situation* may be coloring my perceptions. I'm often tempted to improve that situation with with caffeine or alcohol. In the long run, neither is a great solution. They just add another pair of tinted glasses over the ones I'm already wearing.

Beyond "simple" biochemistry, we're affected by all the habits and opinions we've built up &ndash; good *and* bad &ndash; over the course of our lives. Those habits of mind and body often place yet another set of tinted lenses in front of the others.

Anyone who's played with colored filters and light sources knows that after a while it can be hard for anything to shine through. We get so used to squinting through these filters that we no longer know what things look like without intermediaries.

It's hard to figure out how a trap works from the inside. It can be even harder to figure out how to *open it* from the inside. We can't even try to remove our perceptive filters if we don't realize they're there in the first place. 

I wish the solution was as simple as taking off a pair of glasses. Maybe the best place to start is by not putting so many on in the first place.
