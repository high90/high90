Sometimes I wonder about the filters that sit between reality and how we experience it.

I can be moody at times, and when I finally pull myself out of whatever funk I'm in, it's often due to a gap in personal maintenance. 

Lack of sleep can hit me hard, and it tends to build over time. Not enough healthy food, an excess of unhealthy food, and too little water can make a big difference in my daily mood. Regular exercise is tough at first, feels great when I get into a routine, and is the first commitment I let go of when things get busy.

Whenever these sorts of personal maintenance tasks get out of whack, it's like I put on a pair of tinted glasses. Something with me is wrong, but instead of that I feel like something in the world is wrong.

There is a great temptation to make everything better with caffeine, and/or alcohol. In the long run, neither is a great solution. They just end up being a different pair of tinted glasses for me to put over the ones I'm already wearing.

Beyond "simple" biochemistry, there are all the habits and opinions we've built up for ourselves &ndash; good *and* bad &ndash; that just keep more and more tinted lenses in front of the others.

Anyone who has played with colored filters and light sources knows that after a while it's hard for anything to shine through. But often we're so used to seeing through these filters that it's tough to know what things look like without them as an intermediary.

It can be difficult to figure out how a trap works from the inside. It can be even harder to figure out how to open it from the inside. We can't decide to remove the filters in our lives  if we don't realize they're on in the first place. 

I wish it were as easy as taking off a pair of glasses. Maybe we can start by not putting them on in the first place.
