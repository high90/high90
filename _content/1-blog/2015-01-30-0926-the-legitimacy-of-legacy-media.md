[Hank Green](http://hankgreen.com/) got to interview the President after his State of the Union Address, alongside [Glozell Green](http://glozell.com/) and [Bethany Mota](https://twitter.com/bethanymota). The interviews were met with widespread [derision](https://twitter.com/rupertmurdoch/status/558794054990057474) by legacy media outlets because the interviewers in question built and serve their audiences via social media, primarily YouTube.

In [response](https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/558802410626641920) to this derision, Green wrote an [outstanding piece](https://medium.com/@hankgreen/holy-shit-i-interviewed-the-president-fa3e8fb44d16) about the experience and the reactions he encountered. A core part of his article centers around the sources of legitimacy for legacy and new media outlets. 

Here's a key quote:

> People trust us because weâ€™ve spent years developing a relationship with them. We have been scrutinized and found not evil. Our legitimacy comes from honesty, not from cultural signals or institutions.

[Phil Plait](https://twitter.com/badastronomer) has a [great perspective](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/01/30/hank_green_news_media_and_the_president.html) on the root of legacy media's declining legitimacy as well:

> ...the trust they rely on now has, in many cases, been squandered if not cynically exploited and [outright betrayed](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/04/08/fox_news_leading_cable_news_network_is_usually_wrong_about_climate_change.html). The 24 hour news cycle is a huge factor in this, I think; that is a lot of time to fill, and nonsense loves to occupy that space. But corporate ownership is a huge part of the problem, especially when the owners are dogmatic ideologues with an agenda.

He's seen it firsthand in the battle over climate change. If you're not reading his blog [Bad Astronomy](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy.html), you should give it a try.

As for the interview itself, I thought it was great. Their questions were certainly more interesting and heartfelt than most of the offerings from mainstream media outlets, and I thought they chose their issues and questions well.

It was also fascinating to see how Google is using their new [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) just about everywhere they can now, including their deck of slides for the President.

They looked nice.
