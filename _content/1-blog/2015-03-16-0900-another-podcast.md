When I [discussed](http://themindfulbit.com/blog/focus) stepping away from [Technical Difficulties](http://technicaldifficulties.us) so I could focus, I never expected that the process could possibly include another podcast. And yet, here we are.

<p class="has-pullquote" data-pullquote="Simplecast got us on iTunes within 36 hours" markdown="1">Bob and I are trying to make something more substantial out of our little company. For now, that means writing regularly and recording our new show, which we've cleverly named [*high90cast*](http://high90.pub/high90cast). </p>

The new show has also given us a chance to try out [Simplecast](https://simplecast.fm/), and we really like it so far. We'll have more to say about the technical details of the show and our impressions of Simplecast in a future post, but they got our show on iTunes within 36 hours, so that's a major victory.

Bob and I aren't sure exactly where our show is going yet, but we're starting off with a 30 minute episode on [wearables](http://high90.pub/high90cast/001-wearables). If you'd like to listen in on a regular basis, I've posted a few relevant links below. 

Thanks for reading, and (now, once again) thanks for listening.
