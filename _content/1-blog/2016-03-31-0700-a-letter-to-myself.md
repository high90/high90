Stop worrying about what tools other people are using. Stop worrying about their workflows, how the thing you bought yesterday sucks, and how the new thing made everything better. Stop now, it’s ruining you.

I know you hate not being good at things. You want a shortcut, not necessarily to great — or even good — but at the very least, to semi-competent beginner. Past the Dunning–Kruger effect, past the plateaus, past the pits of despair.

So, you turn to the experts. Good thinking. See how they got started. See where they ran into problems along the way. Maybe get in touch with them, ask how you should get started. Maybe get some feedback on your progress.

<p class="has-pullquote" data-pullquote="I hate to break it to you, but you're not good at eBay.">But that’s not what you do, is it?</p>

Not a chance. That’s slow. That’s boring. That’s beneath you. You're better than that.

I know you realize it’s not that easy. But I also know you think that if you can smooth that path, remove whatever obstacles you can, you won’t be held back anymore. Then you’ll finally start the hard work.

It’s always about the tools with you. They’re tangible. You get to research, you get to buy, you get to organize. You love that part. And when you look at those “pro tools” in your office, you know you’re halfway there. And if you got the right thing, it won’t, it can’t, hold you back.

How’s that working out for you?

A few years ago you wanted to get back into playing guitar. You went out and picked out a guitar, FX, amp, books, the works. What’s the first thing you did?

You bought another guitar. Yes you did. You spent so much time researching, the newness wore off. Something shinier came out, and that was going to motivate you.

I’m not trying to beat you up here. I get it. Sometimes you’re busy with other things. That’s okay. It’ll be there when you’re ready. Sometimes you simply don’t enjoy it, that’s fine too. Let it go. Move on. You’re not lacking for hobbies.

No, what bothers me is that you have something you love, have the time, but rather than play with your new toy, you research a little more, read one more review, peruse one last forum post. Inevitably you find something wrong with your toy. Something better. And you sell it, wait for the better to arrive. Then you can finally get started.

That’s not going to work. And, I hate to break it to you, you’re not good at eBay. It’s not surprising that nearly-new, quality, in-demand, and expensive stuff sells well. The market is reminding you that the tools you have are more than sufficient.

Look, I’m not mad at you for trying new things. I’m not even mad at you for buying new toys. And you know I can’t even fault you for wanting to buy good tools. All I’m asking is you give the damn thing a shot before you move on to the next thing. Allow it, and you, to fail.

You know what you need to do. You’re not missing the perfect productivity software tool. There’s no flag, checkbox, or tag for motivation. There's no filter for anxiety or doubt.

You simply need to do.

When you do that, wonderful things happen. Trust me, I’ve known you my entire life.
