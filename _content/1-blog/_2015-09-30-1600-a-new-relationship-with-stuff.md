I love stuff. Shocked, I'm sure.

Lately however, something's changed. I'm not sure that that is, or whether is a permanent change, or just another part of one of my many great cycles. But right now, I don't feel like talking about my things, and would much rather talk about what I'm doing with them, and I think that's something worth exploring.

<aside markdown=1>I started this line of thought lamenting how tired I am of meta-work, and how ready I am to get back to real work. But somehow it's okay for me to spend time discussing why I don't want to talk about meta-work. Apparently meta-meta-work is allowed.</aside>

After years of research, making lists, buying and selling, *re*-buying and *re*-selling, the conclusion I've come to is this: There are things I like, and things I don't like. Wow. Insightful. Case closed.

Fortunately, I'm still me, and I'm not going to let this rest. And since meta-meta-stuff (I'll stick to the Meta(2)-stuff notation) discussion is okay, let's see where this goes.

First, we need categories.

- Tools. Stuff that lets me make other things.
- Toys. Stuff that lets me make fun.
- Trophies. Not sure I like the name, but I couldn't pass up the alliteration. Decorative things, sentimental things.

Whether I've meant to or not, I realize most of my attempts to reign in my stuff obsession has centered on forbidding myself from buying stuff in the Toys or Trophies categories.  That's just silly. While I love making things with my tools, is there any logic in not allowing myself fun or sentiment?

Additionally, I feel my worst purchases have been tools. Or things purchased under the guise of tools.

Now I see where I've gone wrong.

A tool — let’s use a Chromebook — that doesn’t have a use becomes a toy, or worse, a trophy. And if it’s not particularly fun — again, the Chromebook — it fails as a toy. And something I’ve never used, I certainly have no attachment to it, so it fails even more as a trophy.

I have spent so much time worrying about whether I have too many toys (I do), or whether I need more tools (I don’t), when the real disconnect was that I wasn’t letting my things do what they were meant to do, their raison d'être.

Use (and abuse) tools. Play with toys. Display my trophies. Keep what I use. No more, but, no *less*.
