Eddie Smith [describes](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2016/04/03/static-and-free.html) moving his blog [Practically Efficient](http://www.practicallyefficient.com) from Squarespace to Github-hosted Jekyll:

> My time with Squarespace ended today. It was never an entirely happy marriage between us, and itâ€™s not worth spilling every detail why, but I will say that the main thing that ultimately drove me from Squarespace for good was its poorly implemented Markdown editor.

[Eddie's](https://twitter.com/eddie_smith) clear explanation of the process and his reasoning behind the change are well worth reading. They mirror my experience closely.

For those who don't have strong feelings about *how* their blog works, Squarespace can be a great solution. Those of us who are a little more finicky about design, format, and ownership are doomed to wander the wastes looking for our own answers. 

There are many options, and Eddie chose an excellent one.
