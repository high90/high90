> Angular wants you to build your application in a particular way, but it’s not very explicit about it. Call it “passive-aggressive architecture.”

I've been building a few pet projects with Angular over the last year. Like a lot of folks, I was captivated how Angular handled data-binding which made rapid-prototyping *almost magical*. It was only too easy to attribute any complications and frustrations to inexperience, especially with so many developers championing the framework.

Only now have I started to realize there might be fundamental issues with it. The Angular team agrees, having announced [version 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNmWybAyBHI&list=UUEGUP3TJJfMsEM_1y8iviSQ), a ground-up rebuild that has not been without [controversy](https://medium.com/@jeffwhelpley/screw-you-angular-62b3889fd678).

I have a lot to say about Angular, and web applications frameworks in general, but for now [James Shore](https://twitter.com/jamesshore)'s review of Angular hits the nail on the head.
