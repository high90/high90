# Taking your business to the cloud? Let high90 build your engines.

Welcome to the 21st century. All businesses—whether they like it or not—are becoming web software businesses. We can help.

Just ask [Senex Law, PC](http://senexlaw.com/).

Starting as Sage Law Practice Group with one lawyer, a tiny team, and a dream, they set out to become the best online multifamily law firm in the country. To bring that dream to life, high90 built Senex.

With the ability to process tens of thousands of legal documents a month, Senex lets a dozen people perform high-volume monthly legal processing that would need a staff of thousands the old way. They do it faster, better and cheaper too.

The Senex web application is all online, so clients can work from anywhere. We moved their entire email and document management system to the cloud, then upgraded the staff to reliable and secure Macs, iPads and iPhones. Costs dropped, availability soared.

People liked our app so much, they renamed the company after it.

Along the way, we made them a [responsive website](http://senexlaw.com/), [a snappy trade-show booth](../assets/img/booth.jpg), [a cool paint job for their '67 Mustang](../assets/img/mustang.jpg), [brochures](../assets/img/brochure.jpg), [fact-sheets](../assets/img/factsheet.jpg), and [letterhead](../assets/img/letterhead.jpg).

Senex Law is now the fastest growing multifamily law firm in the country, more than doubling in size and revenue each of the last three years. Additional law firms and multifamily properties are lining up to use Senex because it's the best in the business.

# We built it for them. We can build it for you too.
