summary: 'Back from two months vacation (or something) Bob and Erik invite producer Mark VanderClay to talk about how Snake People feel about streaming music services. Next they talk about how each approaches music today, how the launch of Apple Music impacts their musical workflows, and whether Apple Music ignores the "prime curator".'
