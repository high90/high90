We're testing out a few things with our broadcasting setup, and we're really excited about how it's going so far.

We tried out Periscope for live video streaming last episode and while experienced had some bumps, it went great. The best thing we added this week was producer [Mark Vanderclay](http://twitter.com/djtaco) to handle the chatroom and live listener questions.

We're also starting a YouTube channel for episode video. This week it's in ugly (Periscope generated) portrait orientation with terrible audio, but we plan to fix that with true landscape video and high-quality audio next week. 

If that's not enough to turn you off, the first video episode is embedded below.
