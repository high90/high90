I have a thing for trees. 

There's always been something great about sitting outside under a big tree on a breezy day. It seems inaccessible to me, an island of calm unaffected by the clamor around it.

There's a small memorial park just outside the base in Fallon that's unfailingly empty. It's a simple place&mdash;just a few picnic benches, a couple of clumps of trees, and a gravel parking lot. 

One of the big trees at the park is set off from the others. When I'm spending the day in Fallon and get a moment free I like to sit under it and read or write. I'm sitting there right now in fact&mdash;enjoying the  wind in the leaves, the cars wooshing by, and the occasional screams of a few dozen fighters as they depart overhead for today's training in the Nevada basin and range.

There's a similar tree by the Visitors Quarters in Key West. It's in a grassy field down by the water near an unused parking lot, an old hangar, and some ancient ramps that haven't seen a seaplane in over a half-century. 

When I used to visit Key West more regularly, I'd hang out under that tree and read about philosophy, architecture, or art from one of the great second-hand titles I dug up in an out-of-the-way bookstore just off Duval Street. The location seemed to demand more substantial topics. Who was I to argue?

Over the last few years, I've felt like I have fewer peaceful moments than ever, despite working from home for clients that live a continent away. I think the challenge for me is that the internet is practically everywhere now, and there are few barriers to checking email, Twitter, or the latest news wherever and whenever we feel like it.

That makes quiet places like this one more precious than they have ever been. And in an age of ubiquitous connectivity I guess that means peace is found wherever we allow ourselves to find it&ndash;even if it's under the departure end of Runway 31L just outside NAS Fallon, NV.
